Acid Maps

SYNOPSIS
AMS (Acid Map Server) is basically a web server that generates interpolated images from a set of valued points in real time. This means that you can use your existing datasets (e.g.: sales, temperature, etc...) to generate advanced visualizations: heatmaps, isolines and Voronoi diagrams.

Using the plugin of Acid Map for Geoserver, you can use a WMS layer of points to generate an AMS layer. You only need to add some additional parameters to WMS request.

QUICK START
	
	Copy AcidMaps library for to your system library path. For example, in linux, copy libacid-maps-jni.so to /usr/lib/	
	Copy Geoserver acidmaps-*.jar to WEB-INF/lib of deployed

	Now, you can use any WMS layer in Geoserver whose geographic data is a point and has a Numeric column to be interpolated. You only need to add some parameters to WMS request 	and Geoserver will return an AMS map. An example of AMS request with OpenLayers:

	wms = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
		"sf:bugsites - Untiled", "http://ams.xoomcode.com/geoserver/wms",
		{
			LAYERS: 'sf:bugsites',
			STYLES: '',
			format: format,
			VALUE_COLUMN:"cat",
			SIMPLIFY_METHOD: 3,
			SIMPLIFY_SIZE:90,
			'INTERVALS[]':"10,20,45,70,100",
			'INTERVALS_COLORS[]':"0xffffffcc,0xff0000cc,0xffff00cc,0xff00cc,0xffcc",
			RENDERER_TYPE:2,
			INTERPOLATION_STRATEGY:2,
			RADIUS:40,
			SERVICE:"AMS"
		},
		{singleTile: true, ratio: 1} 
	);
