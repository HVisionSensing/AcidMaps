AcidMaps

SYNOPSIS

  AcidMaps is an open source library that generates interpolated images from a
  set of valued points in real time.
  
  It's can be used to generate advanced visualizations with point datasets:
  (e.g.: sales, temperature, atmospheric pressure, population)

  
USAGE

  AcidMaps is compiled as a shared library. 
  You can use it from C/C++ programs, Python (through CTypes), Java (through
  JNI), and any other system that can access a native library.
  
  Also in the downloads page you can find some pre-compiled AcidMaps packages
  which should cover common uses. We'll see how to use it with GeoServer (>= 2.1) in the
  following quick start.

  
QUICK START

  The GeoServer plugin of AcidMaps allows you to use existent layers
  to generate interpolated maps.

  (NOTE: This plugin relies on functionality added on GeoServer 2.1,
  previous versions are not supported)

  1. Download JNI adapter (http://goo.gl/HwJQ4) and extract to your system library path.
     (e.g.: /usr/lib/libacidmaps-jni.so)

  2. Download GeoServer plugin (http://goo.gl/0qb7a) and extract to Geoserver lib directory. 
     (e.g.: geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/acidmaps-2.0.jar)
  
  3. Start GeoServer and try this
     http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms?service=AMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=sf:bugsites&styles=&bbox=590223.4382724703,4914107.882513998,608462.4604629107,4920523.89081033&width=938&height=330&srs=EPSG:26713&format=image/png&VALUE_COLUMN=cat&SIMPLIFY_METHOD=3&SIMPLIFY_SIZE=90&INTERVALS[]=10,20,45,70,100&INTERVALS_COLORS[]=0xffffff80,0xff000080,0xffff0080,0x00ff0080,0x0000ff80&RENDERER_TYPE=2&INTERPOLATION_STRATEGY=2&radius=40

  4. Opaaaa!

  Now, you can use any WMS layer in GeoServer whose geographic data is a point 
  and has a Numeric column to be interpolated.
  
  You only need to add some parameters to WMS request and GeoServer will return 
  an AMS interpolated map.
  
  An example of AMS request with OpenLayers:

  wms = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
    "sf:bugsites - Untiled", "http://ams.xoomcode.com/geoserver/wms",
    {
      LAYERS: 'sf:bugsites',
      STYLES: '',
      format: format,
      VALUE_COLUMN:"cat",
      SIMPLIFY_METHOD: 3,
      SIMPLIFY_SIZE:90,
      'INTERVALS[]':"10,20,45,70,100",
      'INTERVALS_COLORS[]':"0xffffffcc,0xff0000cc,0xffff00cc,0xff00cc,0xffcc",
      RENDERER_TYPE:2,
      INTERPOLATION_STRATEGY:2,
      RADIUS:40,
      SERVICE:"AMS"
    },
    {singleTile: true, ratio: 1} 
  );
