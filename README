AcidMaps

SYNOPSIS

  AcidMaps is an open source library that generates interpolated images from a
  set of valued points in real time.
  
  It's can be used to generate advanced visualizations with point datasets:
  (e.g.: sales, temperature, atmospheric pressure, population)

  
USAGE

  AcidMaps is compiled as a shared library. 
  You can use it from C/C++ programs, Python (through CTypes), Java (through
  JNI), and any other system that can access a native library.
  
  Also in the downloads page you can find some pre-compiled AcidMaps packages
  which should cover common uses. We'll see how to use it with Geoserver (>= 2.1) in the
  following quick start.

  
QUICK START

  The geoserver plugin of AcidMaps allows you to use existent layers
  to generate interpolated maps.

  (NOTE: This plugin relies on functionality added on Geoserver 2.1,
  previous versions are not supported)


  1. Download Geoserver plugin from downloads page
     AcidMaps_x.x_Geoserver_Plugin.tar.gz
     (https://github.com/XoomCode/AcidMaps/downloads)
  
  2. Extract and copy acidmaps-x.x.jar to geoserver/WEB-INF/lib
  
  3. Download a version AcidMaps JNI adapter that suits your environment.
     OS and architecture. e.g.: AcidMaps_x.x_JNI_Linux.tar.gz
  
  4. Copy AcidMaps JNI adapter to your system library path.
	   e.g.: In linux, you should copy libacid-maps-jni.so to /usr/lib/	

  5. Start geoserver

  Now, you can use any WMS layer in Geoserver whose geographic data is a point 
  and has a Numeric column to be interpolated.
  
  You only need to add some parameters to WMS request and Geoserver will return 
  an AMS interpolated map.
  
  An example of AMS request with OpenLayers:

	wms = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
		"sf:bugsites - Untiled", "http://ams.xoomcode.com/geoserver/wms",
		{
			LAYERS: 'sf:bugsites',
			STYLES: '',
			format: format,
			VALUE_COLUMN:"cat",
			SIMPLIFY_METHOD: 3,
			SIMPLIFY_SIZE:90,
			'INTERVALS[]':"10,20,45,70,100",
			'INTERVALS_COLORS[]':"0xffffffcc,0xff0000cc,0xffff00cc,0xff00cc,0xffcc",
			RENDERER_TYPE:2,
			INTERPOLATION_STRATEGY:2,
			RADIUS:40,
			SERVICE:"AMS"
		},
		{singleTile: true, ratio: 1} 
	);
